\begin{abstract}
  A critical part of scientific discovery is the
  communication of research findings to peers or the general public.
  Mastery of the process of scientific communication improves the
  visibility and impact of research. While this guide is a necessary
  tool for learning how to write in a manner suitable for publication
  at a scientific venue, it is by no means sufficient, on its own, to
  make its reader an accomplished writer. We also describe the rules
  for submission in the computational intelligence laboratory.
  This guide should be a
  starting point for further development of writing skills.

\section{Introduction}

Recommender systems have gained increasing popularity in the last 10-15 years, mainly due to their immediate market applications. The huge selection of products online offer retailers the opportunity to attract a wide-range of clients. However, it also means that users can no longer be expected to browse through everything available until they find the film, song or book they like the most. Good recommendations are key to both making the correct products available to the appropriate audience, but also to creating a unique, personalised experience which will attract new clients. These ideas are fundamental for many leading online businesses [ref netflix, ref amazon, ref something else].

In this paper, we concentrate on the collaborative-filtering approach to recommender systems, which relies on previous user experiences (ratings), rather than pre-defined user profile [some ref about the two types]. We use the Netflix dataset with ratings from 10000 users on 1000 films, which has driven a lot of the innovation in the area and allows us to compare our solutions to the state-of-the-art. 

Our main contribution consists of combining latent factor models (SVD, SGD SVD, RBM) and neighbourhood models (user- and item-based kNN) to produce a robust recommender system which optimises the RMSE of predicted ratings on X[how many films] from Blaa to Bllaa. Furthermore, we show that the addition of a more complex learning rate algorithm improves the score significantly, to X. 

In Section \ref{sec:models} we describe the idea and the implementation of our systems. We present the results from the local evaluation of the models and from the validation set on Kaggle in Section \ref{sec:results}. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:discussion} we interpret the improvements we achieved and discuss potential weakness and future work.



\section{Models and Methods}
\label{sec:models}

\subsection{Data Model}

Matrix with bla users and bla films and some number of ratings. Clearly most of the films are not rated by all (or most) users, thus it is a very sparse matrix.

\subsubsection*{Latent factor models} Something about how it is based on finding an underlying model of latent user and film features which explain the rating.

\subsubsection*{Neighbourhood based} Something how it is based on finding similar users or similar films

\subsection{Algorithms}
We investigated three algorithms which concentrate on solving the latent-factor model problem and two which work on the neighbourhood model:
SVD: 

SGD for SVD:


RBM


user-based kNN: Find the top k most similar users using a Pearson distance metric. The rating is the weighted average of the top k user\'s rating for the film.

item-based kNN: Calculate the similarity between the films a user has already rated and the film in question. The predicted rating is then a weighted average of their ratings using the similarities as weights.

\subsection{Bold Driver Learning Rate} 
One of the biggest boosts to our system was the incorporating of the bold drive technique in the calculation of the learning rate in both SGD and RBM. This is an adaptive learning rate given by:
[some formula]

\subsection{Parameter optimisation and validation} 
The general protocol for training and testing followed the steps below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a random subset of the test samples for a local validation set if not already chosen. This was in most cases 5\% of the data, so xxxx samples and was only done by the first algorithm, so that all algorithms are trained on the same data.

\item Train each individual algorithm on the leftover test dataset. In some cases, such as in the item-base kNN, the validation set was used to automatically choose the optimal k in the predefined range. In the iterative algorithms like SGD and RBM, we used the validation set as an early indication on whether the error is really falling with every step. We would often optimise certain parameters using this validation data, such as number of features to user or algorithm iterations (see results for details).

\item Each algorithm generates predictions for the local validation set and the test set which would be uploaded on Kaggle.

\item The predictions from all algorithms are combined using linear regression. The regressor is trained on the predictions generated for local validation set for which we have ground truth. The coefficients which fit the results best are then used to generate a final prediction from all individual predictions for the online test dataset.

\end{enumerate}



\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{denoised_signal_1d}
  \caption{Signal compression and denoising using the Fourier basis.}
  \label{fig:denoise-fourier}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{local_wdenoised_1d}
  \caption{Signal compression and denoising using the Daubechies wavelet basis.}
  \label{fig:denoise-wavelet}
\end{figure}

Use examples and illustrations to clarify ideas and results. For
example, by comparing Figure~\ref{fig:denoise-fourier} and
Figure~\ref{fig:denoise-wavelet}, we can see the two different
situations where Fourier and wavelet basis perform well. 

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
The models and methods
section should describe what was
done to answer the research question, describe how it was done,
justify the experimental design, and
explain how the results were analyzed.

The model refers to the underlying mathematical model or structure which 
you use to describe your problem, or that your solution is based on. 
The methods on the other hand, are the algorithms used to solve the problem. 
In some cases, the suggested method directly solves the problem, without having it 
stated in terms of an underlying model. Generally though it is a better practice to have 
the model figured out and stated clearly, rather than presenting a method without specifying 
the model. In this case, the method can be more easily evaluated in the task of fitting 
the given data to the underlying model.

The methods part of this section, is not a step-by-step, directive,
protocol as you might see in your lab manual, but detailed enough such
that an interested reader can reproduce your
work~\cite{anderson04,wavelab}.

The methods section of a research paper provides the information by
which a study's validity is judged.
Therefore, it requires a clear and precise description of how an
experiment was done, and the rationale
for why specific experimental procedures were chosen.
It is usually helpful to
structure the methods section by~\cite{kallet04methods}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Layout the model you used to describe the problem or the solution.
\item Describing the algorithms used in the study, briefly including
  details such as hyperparameter values (e.g. thresholds), and
  preprocessing steps (e.g. normalizing the data to have mean value of
  zero).
\item Explaining how the materials were prepared, for example the
  images used and their resolution.
\item Describing the research protocol, for example which examples
  were used for estimating the parameters (training) and which were
  used for computing performance.
\item Explaining how measurements were made and what
  calculations were performed. Do not reproduce the full source code in
  the paper, but explain the key steps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}

Organize the results section based on the sequence of table and
figures you include. Prepare the tables and figures as soon as all
the data are analyzed and arrange them in the sequence that best
presents your findings in a logical way. A good strategy is to note,
on a draft of each table or figure, the one or two key results you
want to address in the text portion of the results.
The information from the figures is
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:fourier-wavelet}.

\begin{table*}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}[c]{|l||l|l|l|}
    \hline
    Basis&Support&Suitable signals&Unsuitable signals\\
    \hline
    Fourier&global&sine like&localized\\
    wavelet&local&localized&sine like\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Characteristics of Fourier and wavelet basis.}
  \label{tab:fourier-wavelet}
\end{table*}

When reporting computational or measurement results, always
report the mean (average value) along with a measure of variability
(standard deviation(s) or standard error of the mean).

\subsubsection{Installation}

There are various different packages available for processing \LaTeX{}
documents.
On Windows, use the Mik\TeX{} package (\url{http://miktex.org/}), and
on OSX use MacTeX
(\url{http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/}). Alternatively, on OSX, you
can install the \texttt{tetex} package via
Fink\footnote{\url{http://www.finkproject.org/}} or 
Macports\footnote{\url{http://www.macports.org/}}.

\subsubsection{Compiling \LaTeX{}}
Your directory should contain at least 4 files, in addition to image
files. Images should be in \texttt{.png}, \texttt{.jpg} or
\texttt{.pdf} format.
\begin{itemize}
\item IEEEtran.cls
\item IEEEtran.bst
\item groupXX-submission.tex
\item groupXX-literature.bib
\end{itemize}
Note that you should replace groupXX with your chosen group name.
Then, from the command line, type:
\begin{verbatim}
$ pdflatex groupXX-submission
$ bibtex groupXX-literature
$ pdflatex groupXX-submission
$ pdflatex groupXX-submission
\end{verbatim}
This should give you a PDF document \texttt{groupXX-submission.pdf}.

\subsubsection{Equations}

There are three types of equations available: inline equations, for
example $y=mx + c$, which appear in the text, unnumbered equations
$$y=mx + c,$$
which are presented on a line on its own, and numbered equations
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:linear}
  y = mx + c
\end{equation}
which you can refer to at a later point (Equation~(\ref{eq:linear})).

\subsubsection{Tables and Figures}

Tables and figures are ``floating'' objects, which means that the text
can flow around it.
Note
that \texttt{figure*} and \texttt{table*} cause the corresponding
figure or table to span both columns.


\subsection{Grading}

There are two different types of grading criteria applied to your
project, with the corresponding weights shown in brackets.
\begin{description}
\item[Competitive] \ \\
  The following criteria is scored based on your rank
  in comparison with the rest of the class.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item time taken for computation (10\%)
  \item average rank for all other criteria relevant to the task, for
    example reconstruction error and sparsity (20\%)
  \end{itemize}
  The ranks will then be converted on a linear scale into a grade
  between 4 and 6.
\item[Non-competitive] \ \\
  The following criteria is scored based on an
  evaluation by the teaching assistants.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item quality of paper (30\%)
  \item quality of implementation (20\%)
  \item creativity of solution (20\%)
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Submission System}

The deadline for submitting your project report is Friday, 22 June
2012.
You need to submit:
\begin{itemize}
\item PDF of paper.
\item Archive (\texttt{.tar.gz} or \texttt{.zip}) of software. Please
  do not forget to include author information in the source archive.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Important:} Please check the submission instructions on the webpage 
as it is the most updated instructions. 

\section{Summary}

The aim of a scientific paper is to convey the idea or discovery of
the researcher to the minds of the readers. The associated software
package provides the relevant details, which are often only briefly
explained in the paper, such that the research can be reproduced.
To write good papers, identify your key idea, make your contributions
explicit, and use examples and illustrations to describe the problems
and solutions.
